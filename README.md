### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a major in Computer Science from Universidad ORT Uruguay. I strongly believe that the most impactful solutions arise from combining technical expertise with strong interpersonal skills. My passion lies in collaborative team efforts and the tangible results that emerge from them.

My expertise encompasses not only initiating projects from their conceptual stages but also seamlessly integrating them into complex solutions. I thrive in both the inception phase and the intricate process of bringing disparate components together to create comprehensive solutions.

Technically, I have a strong foundation in full-stack development. On the front-end, I excel in React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript. On the back-end, I demonstrate proficiency in both Node.js and Python. Additionally, my skills extend to AI/ML implementation, cloud architecture, and systems design. What truly sets me apart is my enthusiasm for learning and embracing new technologies. I relish the challenge of working with Language Model Systems (LLMs) and derive satisfaction from finding innovative solutions to complex problems using this technology.

Beyond technical skills, I possess strong soft skills, including effective communication, team collaboration, and project management. These interpersonal skills enable me to transform good solutions into exceptional ones, delivering projects that create real value for users and stakeholders.

As I explore the ever-changing world of technology, my commitment to continuous learning remains strong, driving innovation. I'm dedicated to staying updated on new trends, acquiring fresh skills, and fostering innovation in the teams I work with. Let's transform good solutions into exceptional ones together!
