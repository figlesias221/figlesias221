### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer with Computer Science major from Universidad ORT Uruguay, I find my passion lies in collaborative team efforts and the tangible results that emerge from it.

My expertise encompasses not only initiating projects from their conceptual stages but also seamlessly integrating them into complex solutions. I thrive in both the inception phase and the intricate process of bringing disparate components together to create comprehensive solutions.

My technical expertise is particularly strong in front-end development, where I excel in React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript. On the back-end, I demonstrate proficiency in both Node.js and Python. However, what sets me apart is my enthusiasm for learning and embracing new technologies and skills. Notably, I relish the challenge of working with Language Model Systems (LLMs) and derive satisfaction from finding innovative solutions to complex problems using this technology.

As I explore the ever-changing world of technology, my commitment to learning continuously remains strong, driving innovation. I'm dedicated to staying updated on new trends, acquiring fresh skills, and fostering innovation in the teams I work with.
