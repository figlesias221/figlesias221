### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 2.5 years of experience and a Computer Science BS from Universidad ORT Uruguay, I find my passion lies in collaborative team efforts and the tangible results that emerge from it.

My expertise extends to initiating projects from their conceptual stages, delving into comprehensive software architecture, and designing full-stack solutions to meet both functional and nonfunctional requirements.

In terms of technical prowess, my strengths lie in React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript for front-end development. On the back-end, I bring proficiency in Node.js and Python. Despite my existing skill set, I maintain an eagerness to learn and embrace new technologies and skills.

As I explore the ever-changing world of technology, my commitment to learning continuously remains strong, driving innovation. I'm dedicated to staying updated on new trends, acquiring fresh skills, and fostering innovation in the teams I work with. :)
